1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,800
Your brain signal
is now calibrated.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You see before you,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,800
a graphic representation of
your emotions made in real time.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,000
Valence: these are pleasant
or unpleasant emotions,

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
positive or negative.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,500
Your emotional data will
cause the soundtrack of the film

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,650
and some visual aspects to vary.

8
00:00:29,60 --> 00:00:31,000
This interaction is not permanent,

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,500
a signal will appear on
the image when itâ€™s happening. 

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,800
I will leave you now in
the company of Sigmund Freud,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,600
who is waiting for you
in Vienna, the year is 1938.
